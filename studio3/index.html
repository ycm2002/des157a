                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <p>There are two players. The player whose turn it is rolls the ball twice. The total of the rolls are added to the current player's score, unless either roll into the "fire". If this happens, this player's turn is over, and it is the other player’s turn. After each player rolls, the current player can either roll again, (assuming the ball did not land in the fire) or if the current player feels that luck is running thin, they can pass to the other player. The first player to get 30 points or higher wins.</p> 
                <p>Oh, and if you roll into the "fire" twice, your current score gets zeroed out. So don’t do that and good luck!</p>
