            <h2>Project Brief</h2>
            <p>The project I choose to update is my mad libs project because I feel like it needs to be updated with new techniques I learned throughout the quarter which can help improve the user's experience. For this project, I plan to improve the project UX/UI. I would like to add more animations to the images on this project as well as adding an over lay once the user completes the mad libs form. In addition to this, I would like to try seeing how different layout may effect the user's experience. The users I plan on sharing my ideas with are the class undergrad design tutor and a user outside from school, possibly a recent graduate student. </p>
