            <h2>Design Comp</h2>
            <p>For the Final Project, I created a couple design comps of how I would like to reiterate the original design of my Mad Libs Project. My aim was to make the theme and design tell more of a story and be interactive for the user. To make the beginning design of the form more interactive, I added more images and animations around the form so that when the user hovers over them, they will do a little animation such as shake. When they submit the form, it will show an image in the background of the two animals they selected in jail. It will change depending on which animals they choose.</p>
