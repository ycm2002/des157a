                <h2>Best UX Practices for Game Design</h2>
                <h3>February 27, 2024</h3>
                <a href="https://uxplanet.org/game-design-ux-best-practices-guide-4a3078c32099">Game Design UX Best Practices</a>
                <p>Amir Dori’s article on best ux game design practices was really interesting and informative to read about. I really enjoyed reading from someone who has worked in the game design field for more than 10 years and to hear which game designs work and which don’t work as well. One key point that stood out to me from this article was how the design and positioning of buttons on a screen can affect the user’s experience. For example, clickable buttons at the top of the screen may be harder to navigate because users typically are holding their device with one hand and are using their thumbs to click buttons. It would be more user friendly to have the main clickable elements within the middle to bottom areas of the screen as their thumb can only reach so far across the screen. Another key detail from this article that stood out to me was how Dori explained the design of sliders. It’s important to show the users that there is more content as you slide. To do this, he suggested starting with an animation that goes from the end/middle to the beginning of the slide or even just partially showing an item so users will see there’s more content to look at as you slide. These are some things I didn’t really think about and will consider when designing my projects.

                    <figcaption>Fig. 1 - Tree Stonecrop Succulent</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>This image is of a succulent called Tree Stonecrop from my family’s garden that we propagated. This is one of many of the succulents we have grown in our garden which is what the topic and story of my project will be about. Growing succulents and the other plants in our garden have bloomed a strong bond between my grandmother, sister and I as we spend time together working in the garden to grow these plants. In the project, I plan to share this experience of propagating succulents with my family as well as the background of each plant as the users interact with the images of them.

                    <figcaption>Fig. 2 - Shu Ren's Image</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Based on my observations of Shu Ren’s image, it looks like this image is of a tour of a historic place or factory as it has a machine that is sectioned off by black rope and has a big title above it that says “ENGINE ROOM”. This makes it seem like the machine was on display for visitors to view and is not in use. The most interesting and mysterious aspect of this image is how the machine is sectioned off and no one is around it. It makes me think that this machine could be valuable, fragile, or even dangerous. </p>

                <h2>Visual Thinking</h2>
                <h3>February 8, 2024</h3>
                <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/"> Visual Thinking Strategies</a>
                <p>Below is a link to a website that has a game called “City Guesser” where there are videos with no context showing the environment of a place and the viewers have to use Visual Thinking to figure out where the location of the video is. Once the user makes a guess by pinning a point on a map, the game will reveal the actual location and how far away their guess was. Users can choose the difficulty level of the game as well as play against others. I think this website is a great example of a way to use videos to motivate Visual Thinking through an interactive game.</p>

                <h2>Overlays</h2>
                <h3>January 31, 2024</h3>
                <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</a>
                <p>After reading about modal windows, I got a better idea on why, when, and how to use them. I learned that it is best to use modal windows when a user is interacting with your site in ways such as filling out a sign up or login form as well as how using them as error messages should be avoided. An important thing to remember when designing modal windows is the size and location. All the content should fit on the modal window and if it doesn’t, then you should consider using a new page rather than the modal window as they shouldn’t take over half a page. Lastly, I learned that it is important to incorporate keyboard buttons such as the escape button to exit out of modal windows. </p>

                <h2>Form Design</h2>
                <h3>January 23, 2024</h3>
                <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best Practices for Form Design</a>
                <p> After reading the assigned article, I learned a lot about what goes into designing a form in an effective way that makes filling out the form clear and easy for the user to do. For example, prior to reading the article, I didn’t think about how the placement of the title of a textbox can make a difference in a user’s experience when they’re filling out a form. After reading the article, I learned that it is important to really think about the placement and proximity of the title so that the user can have a decrease in eye fixations and a faster completion time. I also learned why it is not a good idea to have the title or placeholder inside the textbox because as the user is filling out the textbox, they might forget what the title says or what else they need to fill out, causing them to go back and delete what they already wrote so far. Another thing that stood out to me was how it is essential to include feedback to users when they have finished filling out the form. For example, if they are missing something, the form should highlight in some way what they are missing so they know exactly what to do or, in the case they completed it correctly, that their form was successfully submitted. This allows for the user to get confirmation that they have turned in the form or need to go back and do something. These are just a couple of the many design elements of a form that stood out to me while reading this article where it seems like they are obvious things you know to include, but also maybe things you might forget to consider.

                </a>
                <p>A website that I recently used that exemplifies this is when I logged into my OASIS account and it had me log into the UC Davis central authentication service (CAS). It asked for the username and passwords above its corresponding textbox with no placeholder text. When I left one textbox blank and tried to login, it indicated which textbox I needed to go back and enter information.
