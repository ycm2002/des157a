                <p>After reading about modal windows, I got a better idea on why, when, and how to use them. I learned that it is best to use modal windows when a user is interacting with your site in ways such as filling out a sign up or login form as well as how using them as error messages should be avoided. An important thing to remember when designing modal windows is the size and location. All the content should fit on the modal window and if it doesn’t, then you should consider using a new page rather than the modal window as they shouldn’t take over half a page. Lastly, I learned that it is important to incorporate keyboard buttons such as the escape button to exit out of modal windows. </p>

                <h2>Form Design</h2>
                <h3>January 23, 2024</h3>
                <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best Practices for Form Design</a>
                <p> After reading the assigned article, I learned a lot about what goes into designing a form in an effective way that makes filling out the form clear and easy for the user to do. For example, prior to reading the article, I didn’t think about how the placement of the title of a textbox can make a difference in a user’s experience when they’re filling out a form. After reading the article, I learned that it is important to really think about the placement and proximity of the title so that the user can have a decrease in eye fixations and a faster completion time. I also learned why it is not a good idea to have the title or placeholder inside the textbox because as the user is filling out the textbox, they might forget what the title says or what else they need to fill out, causing them to go back and delete what they already wrote so far. Another thing that stood out to me was how it is essential to include feedback to users when they have finished filling out the form. For example, if they are missing something, the form should highlight in some way what they are missing so they know exactly what to do or, in the case they completed it correctly, that their form was successfully submitted. This allows for the user to get confirmation that they have turned in the form or need to go back and do something. These are just a couple of the many design elements of a form that stood out to me while reading this article where it seems like they are obvious things you know to include, but also maybe things you might forget to consider.

                <p>A website that I recently used that exemplifies this is when I logged into my OASIS account and it had me log into the UC Davis central authentication service (CAS). It asked for the username and passwords above its corresponding textbox with no placeholder text. When I left one textbox blank and tried to login, it indicated which textbox I needed to go back and enter information.
